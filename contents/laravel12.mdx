# Laravel 12 – What's New & How to Get Started

Laravel 12 is here! This release focuses on making development even smoother with new tools, performance improvements, and minimal breaking changes. If you're a Laravel developer, here's what you need to know.

## What's New in Laravel 12?

### 🚀 Modern Starter Kits

Laravel 12 brings new starter kits for React, Vue, and Livewire. These kits come with:

- **Inertia.js** for seamless single-page app experiences.
- **TypeScript** for better maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI** for a sleek design.
- **WorkOS AuthKit** (optional) for easy social login, passkeys, and SSO.

### 🔥 Faster & More Efficient

- **xxHash replaces MD5**, making hashing faster.
- **UUID v7 support**, improving database indexing.
- **MariaDB CLI Support**, so you can now use MariaDB natively in Laravel.
- **Collection::range now includes a step parameter**, making sequence generation more flexible.

### 🔧 Easier Debugging

- **`debug()->suggest()`** helps identify issues faster by suggesting solutions in real-time.

### 🔑 Stronger Password Security

- **New password validation rules** to enforce stronger passwords.
