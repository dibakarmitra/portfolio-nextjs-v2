# Laravel Ownership Package – Simplify Model Ownership in Laravel

Managing ownership relationships between models can get tricky in Laravel projects. The **[Laravel Ownership package](https://github.com/dibakarmitra/laravel-ownership)** by Dibakar Mitra makes it simple and elegant.

## 🚀 What is Laravel Ownership?

This package allows you to assign and manage ownership between different models. For example, a `User` can own a `Project`, `Team`, or any other entity. It uses a clean polymorphic approach without repeating boilerplate code.

## ✨ Features

- Polymorphic ownership handling out of the box.
- Easy to integrate with existing models.
- Supports roles for more advanced ownership structures.
- Database migration included (`ownerships` table).
- Works seamlessly with **Laravel 9, 10, and 11**.

## 📦 Installation

1. Require the package:

    ```bash
    composer require dibakar/laravel-ownership
    ```

    _(if you’re testing the dev branch, use `composer require dibakar/laravel-ownership:dev-main`)_

2. Publish and run the migration:

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=ownership-migrations
    php artisan migrate
    ```

3. Add the `HasOwnership` trait to your models:

    ```php
    use Dibakar\Ownership\Traits\HasOwnership;

    class Project extends Model
    {
        use HasOwnership;
    }
    ```

## 🔧 Usage Example

```php
$project = Project::find(1);
$user = User::find(1);

// Assign ownership
$project->addOwner($user, 'manager');

// Check ownership
if ($project->isOwnedBy($user)) {
    echo "User owns this project!";
}
```

## 🤝 Why Use This Package?

- Keeps your code clean and DRY.
- Avoids writing repetitive relationship logic.
- Flexible enough to handle **teams, clients, vendors, or multi-role ownership**.
